Dancer

i saw the beautiful dancer
where the mistral blew around the hips
she had her legs up to the chin
an altar for the nightly prayers

the hips were firm and without greaves
the backside plump just like a horse
she could push them into such heights
then kissed him up in the gray skies

she then broke her neck in two
and my heart into a thousand crumbs
her last sigh - a forgiveness -
smelled like a wood of garden flowers

from this forest, rank and file,
emerged an army of little birds
they were singing her one last song
while my heart fed on her tombstone

her limbs shall soon become pale blue
but shyly breathe in the sunshine
as long as the heavy hips are warmed
perhaps I could also love her bones.
