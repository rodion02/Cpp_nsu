an altar for the nightly prayers
as long as the heavy hips are warmed
but shyly breathe in the sunshine
i saw the beautiful dancer
she could push them into such heights
she had her legs up to the chin
she then broke her neck in two
the backside plump just like a horse
the hips were firm and without greaves
then kissed him up in the gray skies
they were singing her one last song
where the mistral blew around the hips
